"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

I have used hashmap to store all the cells in spreadsheet. As storing and retrieving
from hashmap has O(1) complexity, hashmap is the perfect match to store cells.

I have recursively checked list of observers for given subject to find if subject is
also an observer for one of its observers.
